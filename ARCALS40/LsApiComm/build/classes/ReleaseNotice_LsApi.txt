January, 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS 
  
  . Added possibility to decode DataMatrix barcodes in the function LSReadBarcodeFromBitmap
  . Possibility to use LS150UV with FW 7.50 or greater
  . Added function LSLoadStringWithCounterLimit to handle "Ranger endorsement emulation mode 
    with rollover parameter
  . Possibility to share the LS scanners among different users via CTS_Sharing_LS program
  . Possibility to pass long documents (up to 330 mm in length) with the LS150 color 
    (LS150 COLOR LEV.11 version 2.15 or higher and  LS150-2 COLOR LEV.1 version 4.11 or higher) 
    with the parameter PAPER_DOCUMENT. In this way the double leafing is checked and it is  
    possible to get front and back images at the same pass.
  . Possibility to set a minimum doc lenght in ini file ( parameter LenDocMinAccepted) and 
    the LS150 will stop if a smaller item is passed. In this case a LS_SHORT_PAPER error code 
    is returned.This is implemented with the LS150 COLOR in the following versions:
    LS150 COLOR LEV.11 version 2.16 or higher and  LS150-2 COLOR LEV.1 version 4.11 or higher.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS 

  . implemented a new paramenter in LSAPI.ini file which allows the user to change automatically
    the threshold used to clear the black. This parameter is called ThresholdBackground . Usually no
    need to change but can be useful in case of very specific checks with dark borders

2. PROBLEMS ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED WITH THIS RELEASE

  . Resolved problem with the LS150, in some cases the LSDocHandle and LSReadCodeline did not
    return the correct codeline but an empty one.     
  . Changed LSAPI because now the DLL is able to work correctly with old and new USB components on the
    LS800 (installed on the device itself) with WXP, W7 and WVista
  . IMplemented a solution for the LS40 in order to make it work as all the other LS scanners. 
    Now E13B codelines with spaces between fields are returned with one blank between each field 
    in the codeline string. It is also possible to ask for codelines without blanks by setting a 
    specific parameter in lsapi.ini file ( refer to BlankInCodeline  parameter in the documentation)
  . Fixed issue with the LS150: in some cases if an image of a card was requested with the deskew 
    parameter activated, it was possible that the image was not returned aligned. This was evident with 
    cards with dark horizontal bands (like magnetic stripe bands) .

3. KNOW ISSUES WITH THIS RELEASE

  . Reported a slow down with the LS800 and with VB6 program in W7 platform. This issue is in analysis
